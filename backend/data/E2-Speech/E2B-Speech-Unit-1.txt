Some people like to sleep late at night. They say they can focus better at night. Others like to wake up early in the morning. They call themselves early birds. Why do people 
have different lifestyles? What are the benefits of each of them?
Some  people  like  to  stay  up  at  night  because  they  can  spend  more  time  with  their  
families.  Parents  usually  work  during  the  morning  and  afternoon.  Many  children  finish 
school, academies, and homework late in the evening. At night, they can sit, talk, and eat dinner  together.  Before  going  to  bed,  they  can  also  spend  some  time  playing  games  or  even watching a movie together. Secondly, it is quiet during the nighttime. During the day, 
there are many things that can distract you. However, at night, you are usually by yourself and everything is much quieter. You can concentrate better on your homework or other activities.  In  contrast,  many  people  think  daytime  is  better.  First,  it  is  much  more  convenient during the daytime. There are more activities that people can do and more stores are open to  the  public.  There  are  also  more  people  out  in  the  street  which  means  that  it  is  much  safer to walk around. Secondly, people are more productive during the day. Children go to school and parents go to work. Everyone has a lot of energy and moves around a lot. During the nighttime, people are usually very still and this makes them lazy.
